# DoubleSearch

### DoubleSearch will halve the amount of time you spend Googling!


DoubleSearch utilizes the wasted space in your Google Search results to add in Reddit search results for the same query, saving you from having to type "site:reddit.com" every time you want to search Reddit.

Thousands of Redditors add "site:reddit.com" to their queries every day — many even set up _shortcuts_ to speed up the process — but this extension drastically reduces the number of searches needed to find your answers.
